#Sheet Management
There are several useful options for managing the multiple sheets in a workbook.

Shows the current options for managing the sheets.
##Unhide all
This option is used to unhide all sheets in the workbook.  This will even unhide those sheets which are set to xlVeryHidden.
##Sheet protect (lock/unlock all)
This feature allows for locking and unlocking all of the sheets in a workbook with a single password.  When the option is selected, it will prompt for the password to use.  Note that if there are issues locking or unlocking a sheet, the code will keep going.  If you are unsure whether or not your sheets are now locked/unlocked, go back and verify.

##Others
This includes the extra items to avoid clutter on the main ribbon.
###Restore scroll bars
This option will restore the size of the scrollbars.  Excel can get out of shape sometimes if you delete a large amount of text.  It will keep the old sized scroll bars.  This is generally fixed by saving the file.  If for some reason you do not want to save the file, this can be used to force it to refresh them.
###Output sheet names
This option is used to output a list of all the sheet names. It outputs to a new Worksheet and includes a hyperlink to each sheet.
